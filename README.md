### [AWS SaaS isolation Strategies](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/saas-tenant-isolation-strategies.pdf)
* Pool: Compute shares but storage are siloed
* Silo: Cell based architecture. Example - AWS accoint level, VPC level, Subnet, 
* Hybrid: Monilithic web tier, rest are siloed. 

The general rule of thumb here is to look at any resource and assess the noisy neighbor and security profile for that resource. Youâ€™ll have to weigh these isolation options against the added complexities, cost, operational burden, and service limits that may come with adopting a silo strategy for some part of your system. Finding the right balance is often key to the success of your system.
The key concept here is that you should attempt to push as much of the details of tenant isolation away from the view of your developers, making as simple as possible for them to apply your isolation scheme.

Tenant isolation general flow: JWT token provided by client -> common library to read JWT token (fetch tenantID) -> gettenantPolicy -> Forward to calling service
